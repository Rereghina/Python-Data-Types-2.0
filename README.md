# Python-Data-Types-2.0 #

## Use Case ##
<b> Objective Statement :</b>
<ol type = 1> <li>Get the insight about sequence, set, and mapping Python data types, and the use of slacing on string </li>
              <li>Get the insight about the different data types in Python </li>
              <li>Get examples of writing syntax for each data type in Python </li>
              <li>To get the insight about methods in python that can be used for each data type </li>
              <li>To get the insight which data types are mutable and immutable </li> </ol>
<b> Challenges : </b>
<ol type = 1> <li>Python is a case sensitive programming language, so the writing of the syntax must be considered</li>
              <li>Difficulty in distinguishing mutable and immutable data types</li>
              <li>Differences in the use of parentheses in the syntax of each data type</li></ol>
<b> Expected Outcome : </b>
<ol type = 1> <li>Knowing more about the data types of List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set, as well as the use of slicing on string </li>
              <li>Knowing how to create sequence, set, and dictionary data types </li>
              <li>Understanding immutable and immutable data types </li>
              <li>Knowing how to write the correct syntax for each data type </li> </ol>
<b> Benefits : </b>
<ol type = 1> <li>As a basic material for learning Python language for beginners </li>
              <li>As additional knowledge about various data types in python </li>
              <li>To get more insight to better know the differences in data types in the Python programming language with other programming languages </li></ol>

## Content ##
<p>In addition to the number, string, and boolean data types, in python there are also sequence, set, and mapping data types.</p>
<b>Sequence Types</b>
<ol type = 1> <li> List 
              <ul> <li>List is an ordered sequence of items </li>
                   <li>List is mutable sequences </li>
                   <li>Created by placing elements inside square brackets [ ] and separated by commas </li>
                   <li>List can have any number of items and they may be of different types </li></ul></li>
              <li> Tuple
              <ul> <li>Tuple is similar to list, but tuple is immutable sequences </li>
                   <li>Tuple generally used for data that is one-time write and can be executed quickly </li>
                   <li>Created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses ( ) and separated by commas </li>
                   <li>Tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types </li></ul></li></ol>

<b>Set Types</b>
<ul> <li>Set is an unordered collection of items </li>
     <li>Set is used to store multiple items in a single variable </li>
     <li>Every set element is unique and immutable </li>
     <li>Can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference </li>
     <li>Created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces { } separated by comma </li></ul>

<b>Mapping Types (Dictionary)</b>
<ul> <li>Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items </li>
     <li>Dictionary can be defined as a collection of data stored in key-value pairs </li>
     <li>Created by placing items inside curly braces { } and separated by commas. The key-value pairs are separated by a colon (:) </li>
     <li>The values can be of any data type and can repeat and the keys must be of immutable type</li></ul>
